# Welcome to Wasup. The open source chat app.


A hobby and school PEP (Personal Exploration Project) using a node.js server for backend and html, javascript and css for frontend. 
The entirety was built my me and took the whole semester.
Features:
- Working messaging app
- Working servers
- Discover servers
- Joining and creating servers
- People tab
- Saving messages and server
- Login/ Sign up (out in 0.7)
- Revamped UI and settings menu (out in 0.8)

I'll update this as I finish features, find my timeline below:

End of feb --> Basic login intergration (0.6.7)
End of march --> Main chat functionality done. (done in 0.6)
End of April --> Login page done. (out in 0.7)
May --> Version 1 + bugs fleshed out.

# Building the app.

Web App:
You will need the following modules:
 ```
npm install bcrypt
```
```
npm install dotenv
```
```
npm install express
```
```
npm install mongoose
```
```
npm install multer
```
```
npm install nodemailer
```
```
npm install socket.io
```
```
npm install socket.io-client
```
Finally, do:
```
npm start
```

Keep in mind this is highly WIP and nowhere near done. I plan to offer support and version until around V3 which will bring it until around December of 2025. 
Messages are secure and can not be accessed by me.
