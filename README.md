A hobby and school PEP (Personal Exploration Project) using a node.js server for backend and html, javascript and css for frontend. 

If you want to build yourself use:
"node server.js" 

The entirety was built my me and took the whole semester.
Features:
- Working messaging app
- Working servers
- DMS (WIP, not out yet)
- Discover servers
- Joining and creating servers
- People tab
- Saving messages and server
- Login/ Sign up (WIP, not out yet)

I'll update this as I finish features, find my timeline below:

End of feb --> DM's functionality
End of march --> Main chat functionaility done.
End of April --> Login page done.
May --> Version 1 + bugs fleshed out.

Keep in mind this is highly WIP and nowhere near done. I plan to offer support and version until around V3 which will bring it until around December of 2025. 
That is if I don't get any support as this is just a hobby project and school project.
Well have fun, do not use real passwords that you use on this as it is **not** secure. Messages are secure and can not be accessed by me.
